# CSE 3311 - Study Abroad App
This is a Flutter application that is developed on Android Studio for future deployment on Andrioid and IOS devices.

## Vision Statement

The app is designed to match the needs of Professor Aiken and the needs of the students as they are abroad providing thems with features such as basic translated phrases for where they are currently studying abroad and map/location information on planned areas of visit.
